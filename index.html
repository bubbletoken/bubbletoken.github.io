    <h2>Basic Overview</h2>
    <p>Join the auction to get NUI Tokens based on how many people have entered the Auction and invested TRX. You can then stake these NUI Tokens to get TRX shares based on the current day's total auction amount.</p>
    <p>Interact directly with the contract via the contract links above.</p>
    <p>If you need assistance using the CONTRACT, click the links above or these to open a new window:</p>
    <p>AUCTION INSTRUCTIONS or STAKE INSTRUCTIONS</p>
    <p>Join the Telegram to get more help: @NuiToken</p>
    <p>Start off at the auction or if you already have NUI Tokens, head over to the staking link and stake them.</p>

    <h2>Project Full Transparency</h2>
    <p>For the first 2 days, all profits will be reinvested back into the auction.</p>
    <p>3% of the previous day's auction will be reinvested in the current day's auction. This will be the case for the first full week.</p>
    <p>1% will be held for liquidity to be added with the Justswap launch on Nov 5th.</p>
    <p>After the first week, 2% of the previous day's Auction will continue to be invested back into the current day's auction every single day.</p>
    <p>There is a ONE DAY lock on share earning on stakes. This means your first day of a stake will not generate dividends from the auction. (Check @NuiToken for an airdrop that is disbursing Nov 2nd around 00:00 UTC</p>
    <p>Lastly, there is a penalty for unstaking early. This is to hopefully mitigate so-called "suicide staking". You will gain all earned TRX shares, but you will lose some NUI Tokens based on how much time is left on the stake if you unstake early.</p>
